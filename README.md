# SillyTavern - WorldInfo Info

Forked from the amazing LenAnderson. Original at https://github.com/LenAnderson/SillyTavern-WorldInfoInfo; this version removes entry text and adds features.

🆕 `/wi-report` shows you what keywords triggered which entry during which round of recursion.

See which WorldInfo entries were active in the last generated message. Click the book in the lower left corner of the screen to see the list of active entries. The book can be dragged to a different location (right-click to enable click to drag).
